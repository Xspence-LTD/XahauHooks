# Secure Savings Manager Hook (SSM) - XahauHooks

A production-ready Xahau hook that creates a time-released manageable escrow system for parent-controlled child savings accounts. Acts as a financial guardian enforcing spending limits and automatic savings discipline.

## Overview

This hook provides secure parent-managed savings accounts with the following features:

- **Automatic Escrow**: All incoming payments automatically locked - no bypass possible
- **Parent/Admin Control**: Only designated parent/guardian can release funds via invoke transactions
- **Spending Enforcement**: Outgoing payments strictly limited to available balance
- **Time-Released System**: Configurable intervals for automatic fund releases
- **Milestone Releases**: Manual releases for birthdays, achievements, rewards, etc.
- **Real-Time Balance Tracking**: Separate locked, available, and spent amount monitoring
- **Emergency Controls**: Safety mechanisms for urgent fund access
- **Pass-Through Design**: Non-payment transactions pass through without interference

## Core Functionality

### Escrow Management
- **Incoming Payments**: All funds automatically locked in escrow (cannot be disabled)
- **Balance Pools**: Separate tracking of locked vs available balances
- **Spending Control**: Child can only spend up to available balance (strictly enforced)
- **Real-Time Deduction**: Available balance reduced immediately on spending

### Parent Controls
- **Release Schedule**: Configure automatic release intervals and percentages
- **Manual Adjustments**: Release funds for milestones and achievements
- **Emergency Access**: Unlock all funds with safety code when needed
- **Complete Oversight**: Full visibility into child's financial activity

## Savings Flow Logic

### Incoming Funds (Automatic Escrow)
1. **Any Payment**: Funds sent to child's savings account
2. **Automatic Lock**: All incoming amounts locked in escrow
3. **No Bypass**: Child cannot access funds until parent releases them
4. **Auto-Release Check**: Trigger automatic interval-based releases if configured

### Parent-Controlled Releases
1. **Manual Releases**: Parent triggers percentage-based releases for milestones
2. **Automatic Releases**: Scheduled releases based on configured intervals
3. **Balance Transfer**: Funds move from locked → available pool
4. **Spending Authorization**: Child can now spend released amounts

### Child Spending (Enforced Limits)
1. **Payment Attempt**: Child tries to send payment from account
2. **Balance Check**: Hook verifies payment amount vs available balance
3. **Approval/Block**: Payment approved if sufficient funds, blocked otherwise
4. **Real-Time Deduction**: Available balance reduced on successful payments

**Example Flow**: 
- **Genesis Mint**: 1000 XAH → Child account (automatically locked)
- **Parent Release**: 20% → 200 XAH available for spending
- **Child Spending**: Can spend up to 200 XAH, remaining 800 XAH stays locked
- **Overspend Attempt**: 300 XAH payment → BLOCKED ("Insufficient available balance")

## Technical Implementation

### Balance Management
- **Locked Balance**: Funds in escrow awaiting parent release
- **Available Balance**: Funds released by parent, ready for spending
- **Spent Tracking**: Running total of all outgoing payments
- **Real-Time Updates**: Balances updated immediately on transactions

### Timing Controls
- **Interval System**: Uses ledger sequences for precise timing (17280 ledgers ≈ 24 hours)
- **Release Constraints**: Prevents rapid manual releases (respects intervals)
- **Auto-Release Logic**: Automatic percentage releases when intervals pass

### Security Features
- **Admin Access Control**: Only designated parent can configure system
- **Spending Enforcement**: Payments physically blocked if insufficient available balance
- **Emergency Safety**: Unlock mechanism with safety code for urgent situations
- **State Isolation**: Each account maintains independent state data

### Transaction Flow
1. Validates transaction type and participants
2. For ttINVOKE: Processes parent configuration or child setup
3. For outgoing ttPAYMENT: Enforces spending limits and updates balances
4. For incoming ttPAYMENT: Locks funds and triggers auto-releases
5. Updates state and provides transaction feedback

## Pass-Through Messages

The hook allows these transactions to pass through unchanged:

- `"Transaction passed through"` - Non-payment transaction types
- `"Outgoing transaction approved"` - Approved child spending (within limits)
- `"Payment locked in escrow"` - Incoming payments successfully locked
- `"Non-XAH payment accepted"` - Non-native currency payments

## Configuration Messages

| Success Message | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| `"Admin configured"` | Parent/guardian account set |
| `"Auto-release percentage configured"` | Automatic release percentage set |
| `"Release interval configured"` | Release timing interval set |
| `"Funds released to available balance"` | Manual/automatic release completed |
| `"Status query completed"` | Balance information retrieved |
| `"All funds unlocked"` | Emergency unlock executed |

## Error Messages

| Error Message | Cause |
|---------------|-------|
| `"Only hook owner can set initial admin"` | Non-owner trying to set initial admin |
| `"Only admin can configure"` | Non-admin attempting configuration |
| `"AUTO_RELEASE percentage must be 0-100"` | Invalid auto-release percentage |
| `"Release percentage must be 1-100"` | Invalid manual release percentage |
| `"Release too soon - wait for interval"` | Manual release attempted before interval elapsed |
| `"No locked funds to release"` | Release attempted with zero locked balance |
| `"Invalid unlock code"` | Wrong emergency unlock safety code |
| `"Insufficient available balance - wait for parent release"` | Child overspend attempt blocked |
| `"No valid parameters"` | ttINVOKE with no recognized parameters |

## State Management

### Hook State (Account-Level Configuration)
- `ADMIN`: Parent/guardian account ID (20 bytes)
- `LOCKED`: Current locked balance in drops (8 bytes)
- `AVAILABLE`: Current available balance in drops (8 bytes)  
- `AUTO_LOCK`: Auto-release percentage for intervals (4 bytes)
- `INTERVAL`: Release interval in ledgers (4 bytes)
- `LAST_RELEASE`: Last release ledger sequence (4 bytes)
- `SPENT`: Total spent amount tracking (8 bytes)

### Balance Calculations
- **Locked Balance**: Funds waiting for parent release
- **Available Balance**: Funds released and ready for spending
- **Total Savings**: Locked + Available balances
- **Spent Total**: Cumulative outgoing payment amounts

## Real-World Use Cases

### Weekly Allowance System
```
Setup: SET_INTERVAL 120960 (1 week), AUTO_RELEASE 15
Result: 15% of locked funds released weekly as allowance
Child gets consistent spending money without daily parent management
```

### Achievement-Based Rewards
```
Child completes chores/goals → Parent: RELEASE 25
Extra funds released as milestone reward on top of regular allowance
```

### Emergency Situations
```
Medical emergency → Parent: UNLOCK 0xDEADBEEF
All locked funds immediately available for urgent expenses
```

### Budget Learning
```
Child attempts overspending → Transaction blocked with clear message
Teaches financial discipline and budget awareness in real-time
```

## Educational Benefits

### Financial Literacy
- **Budget Awareness**: Child learns to live within released amounts
- **Delayed Gratification**: Understanding that savings require patience
- **Spending Discipline**: Real-time feedback on financial decisions

## Integration with Genesis Mint Savings Hook

This Savings Manager Hook is designed to work seamlessly with the Genesis Mint Savings Hook:

1. **Genesis Mint Detection**: Genesis Mint Savings Hook detects ttGENESIS_MINT transactions

3. **Automatic Escrow**: Savings Manager immediately locks all received funds
4. **Parent Management**: Parents control release of accumulated Genesis Mint proceeds
5. **Complete System**: End-to-end automatic savings with parental oversight

This creates a comprehensive **automated capture → controlled release** system for teaching financial responsibility while ensuring savings discipline.
