# Single Beneficiary Delegate Contract (SBDC) - XahauHooks

## Overview
A production-ready Xahau hook for delegate-controlled single-beneficiary distribution. This contract allows a designated delegate to transfer the entire account balance to a beneficiary at any time via invoke.

- **Delegate Control Logic**: The delegate can invoke at any time to transfer the full balance to the beneficiary.
- **No Threshold**: Distribution can occur immediately upon delegate invoke.
- **On-Chain Configuration**: All settings managed via hook parameters.

---

## Features

- **Delegate-Only Trigger**: Only the configured delegate can initiate the distribution.
- **Pass-Through Design**: Non-matching transactions pass through without blocking the hook chain.
- **Immediate Transfer**: No waiting period required.

## Hook Parameters (Set During Installation)

| Parameter    | Size     | Description                                       |
|--------------|----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `BENEFICIARY`| 20 bytes | Beneficiary account ID (recipient of full balance)|
| `DELEGATE`   | 20 bytes | Delegate account ID (authorized to trigger SEND)  |

---

## Delegate Controls (Invoke by Delegate Only)

| Parameter | Size     | Description                                         |
|-----------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `SEND`    | 1 byte   | Trigger distribution of full balance to beneficiary |

---

## How It Works

1. **Configuration**: Hook owner sets the beneficiary and delegate via hook parameters.
2. **Delegate Invoke**: The delegate invokes "SEND" to transfer the full balance to the beneficiary.
3. **Distribution**: The contract transfers the entire balance (minus a small reserve for fees) to the beneficiary.
